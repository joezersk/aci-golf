<P>
This repo contains the sampe running configurations of ACI GOLF Routers, which are peering with the fabric spines in a multipod setup.  I also include an optional configuration for an MPLS-PE router, which is not integrated with ACI but used to simulate a great WAN network and test routing and connectivity towards ACI via the GOLF routers.
